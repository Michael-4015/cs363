    "# Association Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Association analysis uses machine learning to extract frequent itemsets and strong association rules from large datasets. In this assignment you'll be implementing one of the most commonly used algorithms for association rule mining - the Apriori algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset (`large_retail.txt`) that we are going to use has been adapted from the [Retail Market Basket Dataset](http://fimi.ua.ac.be/data/retail.pdf). This dataset contains transaction records supplied by a Belgian retail supermarket store. Each line in the file represents a separate transaction with the item ids separated by space. The dataset has 3000 transactions and 99 different item ids.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are also provided with a smaller dataset (`small_retail.txt`) with 9 transactions and 5 different item ids along with the solutions. You can test and debug your implementation on this smaller dataset."

    "## Apriori Algorithm from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "The Apriori algorithm is a classical algorithm in data mining. It is used for mining frequent itemsets and relevant association rules. In this part, you'll be implementing this algorithm for generating the itemsets that occur enough times to meet the `min_sup` threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation Hint:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the `frozenset` data structure in Python, which is similar to `set` in functionality, to represent the itemsets, because `frozenset` is an immutable (hashable) data structure. You can maintain a dictionary that maps from the itemset (a `frozenset`) to its support count."
